      The Real Estate License Process in NY
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        At Minimum you need:
        <ul>
            <li>To be 18 years old for the Agent License and then by extension 20 years old for the Broker License</li>
            <li>75 hours of class credit within NYSRE before taking a Final Exam, and then the State Exam</li>
        </ul>
          If you've fulfilled both Criteria, all you need to do is get an existing Broker, 
          or real estate firm to take you in for training and verification. 
          Once they have you registered on the eAccess.gov page, all you need to do is work a bit before it comes in the mail.
          Also remember to take the minimum 22.5 Continuing Education classes within every 2 years to renew the license.
          So functionally the only thing stopping you from getting Licensed is Money and Time.
